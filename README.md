These are the resource files needed for the
[Your First Progressive Web App][codelab] codelab.

In this codelab, you'll  build a weather web app using Progressive Web App
techniques. Your app will:

* Use responsive design, so it works on desktop or mobile.
* Be fast & reliable, using a service worker to precache the app resources
  (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) needed to run, and cache the weather data
  at runtime to improve performance.
* Be installable, using a web app manifest and the `beforeinstallprompt` event
  to notify the user it's installable.


## What you'll learn

* How to create and add a web app manifest
* How to provide a simple offline experience
* How to provide a full offline experience
* How to make your app installable

## Getting started
